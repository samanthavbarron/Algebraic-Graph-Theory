\begin{theorem}
    The Smith Normal Form of $G2prod(G_1,G_2)$ where $G_1 = G_2$ are the complete graph on $n$ vertices is given by $$\text{diag}(1,n,...,n,0)$$ where $n$ appears on the diagonal $n-2$ times.
\end{theorem}

This is expected, because when we connect every vertex on the first graph to every vertex of the other graph, by definition we have constructed a complete graph on $2n$ vertices. Hence, the Smith Normal Form is indeed exactly that of the complete graph on $2n$ vertices.

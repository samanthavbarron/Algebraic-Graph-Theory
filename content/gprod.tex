We define a construction of making a product of two graphs with the same number of vertices.

\begin{definition}
    Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, and their respective Laplacians, $L_1$ and $L_2$, we have the following product as defined below.
    
    \begin{equation}
        Gprod(G_1,G_2) =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                L_1 - I_n &   I_n \\
                I_n         &   L_2 - I_n
            \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    
    where the entries of $Gprod(G_1,G_2)$ are in block-diagonal form.
\end{definition}

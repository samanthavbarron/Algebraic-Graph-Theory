The study of graphs when dealing with a Laplacian can be viewed in terms of the Smith Normal Form of the Laplacian. As such, we use computations in Mathematica to explore the properties of the Smith Normal Form for different families of graphs, and make several conjectures.

Throughout this paper unless stated otherwise, we let $G$ be a graph, $L$ be the Laplacian of said graph, $diag(s_1,s_2,s_3,...,s_n)$ be the Smith Normal Form of a given graph on $n$ vertices.
